<br /><b>INTRODUCING backCAT anti-login toolkit<b>
<br />A new security loophole by clayytxn (me :]) was just discovered that allows partial websurfing without logging into the chromebook, bypassing any extensions loaded at login and any account oversee is nonexistent
<br />This is by the Microsoft Login webpage extension used by many orginizations, school, and other institutions that dont use chromeOS's native sign in tool.
