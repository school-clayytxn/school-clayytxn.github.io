## INTRODUCING backCAT anti-login toolkit
<br />A new security loophole by clayytxn (me :]) was just discovered that allows partial websurfing without logging into the chromebook, bypassing any extensions loaded at login and any account oversee is nonexistent
<br />
<br />
<br />This is by the Microsoft Login webpage extension used by many orginizations, school, and other institutions that dont use chromeOS's native sign in tool.
<br />
<br />This is currently under development, it isn't hard to code, since it uses sneaky html links and tricks, currently youtube is 95% supported (Links in description doesn't work, and you CANNOT sign into google)
<br />
<br />I'm trying my absolute hardest to somehow force webpages to load, since clicking weblinks doesn't work (test my other repository and let me know if they work or not)
<br />  Currently I am going to try iframe injection on a random webpage to see if that works, but it is a headache getting webpages to load without a lot of links working (Possible github webpage?) but it also brings the question of how it would work, and I would need pretty fair amount of webpages converted to iframe pages to run, and who knows if it would work or not
